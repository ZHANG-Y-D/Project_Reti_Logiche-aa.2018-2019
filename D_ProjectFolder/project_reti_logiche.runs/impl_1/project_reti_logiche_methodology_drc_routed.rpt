2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell index_masc[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) index_masc[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell index_masc[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) index_masc[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell index_masc[2]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) index_masc[2]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch
